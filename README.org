** Install the plugins
- Download the "Microarray Profile" plugin from [[http://www.optinav.com/MicroArray_Profile.htm][here]].
- Clone the =fiji-ccm-scoring= repository or download the source
- Open Fiji
- Go to =Plugins -> Install=
- Navigate to each plugin sequentially and double click them to install them
- Go to =Plugins -> Scripting -> Refresh Jython Scripts=
- There should now be plugins called =ccm-scoring= and =Microarray Profile= in the Plugins menu
** Name your files appropriately
- Each image you're going to score should be named something memorable (maybe the date?) with no underscores and no special characters (e.g. spaces, dollar signs, etc.)
- Each image should be a =tif= file and should end with the extension =.tif=
** Create a grid
- Open the image to be scored in Fiji
- Go to =Plugins -> Microarray Profile=
- For 96 well plates, you can load the grid =example_plate1= in the repository to display a grid. Alternatively, you can make your own using the =Microarray Profile= interface.
- These are the instructions from the =Microarray Profile= website for aligning a grid:

0. Make sure the number of rows and columns of the cicle grid matches the image. Use Reset Grid if necessary (inputs 4,7,20 for Dot Blot). 
1. Alt-drag a corner ROI so that it aligns with the corresponding corner spot in the image.
2. Shift-drag an adjacent corner so that it is postioned properly. Now the whole edge connecting the two corners should be lined up with the spots.
3. Shift-drag a spot in the interior of the opposite edge until that edge is lined up with the spots. Unless the pattern of spots is distorted, all of the ROIs should now be aligned.
#+end_quote

- An example of an aligned grid is [[file:tutorial_images/aligned_grid.png][here]]. Note that each colony is completely contained in each circle. It's OK that the circles overlap with each other.
- Once your grid has been aligned, hit the =Save Grid= button in the =Microarray Profile= interface.
- *IMPORTANT* Save the grid in exactly this format: "plateName_gridName". Where "plateName" is *exactly* the same name as the image that the grid was aligned on but without the =.tif= extension. "gridName" can be any name that doesn't contain underscores. For example, if your image was called =example.tif=, you could save your grid to be called =example_plate1=.

** Score the images
- Go to =ccm-scorign=
